Feature: Page structure
  Crazy spinach experiment
  As a developer
  I want to do BDD design

  Scenario: Navbar links
    When there is navbar
    Then it should contain required links
 
  Scenario: Links should point to required pages
    When there are links
    # Then nothing else left to test
